            <h1>Cultural and Educational Rights</h1>
            <p>This right is given to minorities to form and govern their own educational institutions. Article 30 is also called the “Charter of Education Rights”.

                Article 30(1): All religious and linguistic minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. (Read about Minority Protection in India in the linked article.)
                
                Article 30(2): The State shall not, when granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.</p>
