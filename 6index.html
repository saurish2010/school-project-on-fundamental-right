          <p>There is a right in India which states that a person can move to Supreme court if he/she wants to get their fundamental rights protected. This right comes under article 32 for Supreme court an article 226 for the high court. It is known as the right to constitutional remedies. In this right, the Supreme court, as well as high court, is given the power to instill the fundamental rights. Furthermore, the power can be issued by local courts also to extend the rights. Although, there is one act which comes under the military law known as the court-martial which is exempted from this right.</p>
